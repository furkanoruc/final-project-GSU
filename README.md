## Abstract
Prediction of future metastasis in patients after breast cancer tumor surgery has potential to be crucial in terms of early diagnosis. In this paper, using histopathology images, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used to predict metastasis patients from low resolution whole slide images. ImageNet pretrained Resnet-18 architecture is adopted as fine tuning model. Grad-CAM visualizations are presented to highlight important regions of images used by the model. Results show that metastasis prediction  is promising using computationally efficient low resolution based models.
